1) Fix the functionality of the "Sort By" feature in the product pagination. Enable sorting by name and price, with the default sorting based on rendering rather than name or price.

2) Fix the price range filter to only show products that fit within the chosen price range.

3)  Create a page that only shows BestSeller products. Keep the same design layout on the front end.

4) Find ways to make the project code better. What code changes would you suggest for improvement? Create a file on the root with improvments.txt and write it down all things you 
think should change on the project.

General rules: 

1) Create a brench from master and work only on your branch, after you finish, push the code to the brench. DO NOT PUSH ON MASTER.
2) You can do whatever you want with the code, if you think your way is better then just implement it in the way you think to finish the questions. 
3) The frontend layouts should be the same. If you want to change the way of using the layouts it's fine but the design should be the same. 
4) Please try to not use ChatGPT to finish this task, but using ChatGPT only to help is the best way to improve yourself.
5) Try to focus more on 4th question, and please write as many suggestions as you have.
